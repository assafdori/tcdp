Generate a Private Key:
	openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.key

Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
	openssl req -new -key /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.csr

Generate the Self-Signed Certificate:
	openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.csr -signkey /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self-signed.crt

Get the Public key out of the certificate:
	openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certificate.crt > public.key
