# Git Recap ðŸ¤–

### Git config:
Use the `git config` command to configure your Git environment, more specifically, the `user.name` and `user.email` settings.

### Git environments:
There are four environments in Git: local, staging (index), repository, and remote.

### Git commands:
These are the most common Git commands: git add, git commit, git push and git pull.

### Git branches:  
Branches are a way of grouping commits together. Branches can be created with 'git checkout -b <name>'.
When a branch is created from main, the last commit is the tip of the dev branch. 
It can be merged into main by changing back to main branch and doing 'git merge dev'
